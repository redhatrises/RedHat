        OpenShift System administrators, regardless of local or remote access,
        have access to command line tools to remove data from OpenShift system
        components. Examples include removing a local file (e.g. through
        the "rm" command) or remotely purging/wiping OpenShift nodes and
        reinstalling them through processes such as Terraform Bare
        Metal (re)installation.

        This capability is an intrinsic property of being a
        OpenShift System Administrator with remote access
        credentials.
