        CoreOS System administrators, regardless of local or remote access,
        have access to command line tools to remove data from CoreOS system
        components. Examples include removing a local file (e.g. through
        the "rm" command) or remotely purging/wiping CoreOS nodes and
        reinstalling them through processes such as Terraform Bare
        Metal (re)installation.

        This capability is an intrinsic property of being a
        CoreOS System Administrator with remote access
        credentials.
